### Iâ€™m Ramiro, a product designer that likes to code from Monterrey, Mexico. 

I spend my time crafting interfaces, thinking about design systems, and tinkering with front-end code. While my [website](https://ramiroruiz.com) is currently in the process of being redesigned (with some outdated work lingering around), you can still find my some of my [thoughts](https://ramiroruiz.com/notes), [photos](https://ramiroruiz.com/photos), [replies](https://ramiroruiz.com/replies), [likes](https://ramiroruiz.com/likes) and [links](https://ramiroruiz.com/links) I find interesting there.

- ðŸŒ± Exploring new ways to bridge design and code.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about design, CSS, design systems, martial arts.
